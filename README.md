# WWDC22

That's my WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge submission! üéâ

##Summary

In my submission, I tried to bring a little bit of the reality where I live. Therefore, the place where I live suffers a lot from the improper disposal of garbage that ends up harming the people who live in the city. With this in mind, I came to the conclusion that if we make people aware of how this disposal should be done, it is already a great start for society as a whole.
